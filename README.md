# Dragon-Game

I tried to create the follow-up of a project uploaded by Code With Harry on Youtube.

This project is a game where the **Dragon** keeps attacking the **Dino** and Dino has the chance to save itself by jumping. 

The Dino can **move Up, Left and Right**. For every succesful rescue, **score updates**.

### Additions from my side:
 #### 1. Buttons to start the game, moving the Dino. 
 #### 2. Better CSS
 #### 3. Instructions text, Fav icon
